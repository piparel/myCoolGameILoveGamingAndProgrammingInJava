### Why its useful
Playing games is fun and gets your mind off of things
Our project can be played casually without stress

Its useful for us to study and write code to understand how it works.
We reinforce the knowledge that we learned during lessons to use it in real situations.
We learn to code cooperatively and finish a project in a group of 2

### How will we do it
Using no external libraries we will code the necessary elements for an RPG game.
The previously learned topics like Classes and Encapsulation will be used to implement the desired features, so that the user gets a smooth playing experience.
The gameplay will be in the console and actions will be done by console commands


Our game will need low memory and very low minimal requirements so the game can be enjoyed even on samsung smart fridges or your smart watch!!!
